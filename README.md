Upon launching the application, the first screen displayed is the login screen, where users need to enter their credentials. An error message will appear if the credentials are incorrect. If the credentials are correct, the menu screen will be displayed.

There are five different menu screens, one for each role. The Manager screen is highlighted here as it includes the largest subset of features. The Admin features, not included under the Manager's features, are self-explanatory and straightforward.

On the Manager screen, there are four buttons:
1. **Log an Issue:** Click this to enter a new issue. Fill in the required information and submit the form.
2. **Check All Issues:** This allows viewing of all issues logged in your city. You can view more details about an issue or opt to take it up. Issues that are taken up will then be visible under the 'Issues taken up' button in the 'More' menu.
3. **More Menu:**
   - **Issues Taken Up:** Here, you can view the issues you've taken up. Click on an issue to view details or update its status through the dropdown menu.
   - **Team Issues:** View issues taken up by your team. Clicking on an issue shows details and a 'Re-assign' button, which leads to a list of employees to whom the issue can be reassigned.
   - **Monitor Reports:** This screen displays graphs that can be scrolled horizontally, showing various categories and constraints.
   - **Logout:** Logs you out and redirects to the login screen.

To close the application, use the back button on your Android device.
